# Bayesian_Persuasion_Uncertainty

This project addresses the case study of the Bayesian Persuasion framework, where the Sender is not fully aware of the payoff values of the Receiver, but he has only a rough estimate of them. Indeed the Receiver may play sub-optimally from the Sender point of view. To counteract the unpredictability of the Receiver we chose a worst case scenario approach in order to find a robust signaling scheme which maximizes the minimum expected Sender utility.
